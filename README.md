# Patrick-s-Utils
A Custom Scratch extension

Compatible with Scratch, Turbowarp, and Gandi IDE.

The first block runs whatever JavaScript you want to, and the second block is just a modified version of https://extensions.turbowarp.org/sound.js so that it works on Gandi.

If you want to use this just paste https://bimpatman.github.io/Patrick-s-Utils/Patricks-utils.js into the platform you are using.
